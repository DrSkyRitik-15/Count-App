# Count App

This repository contains a simple Count app built using Kotlin. The app allows users to increment and decrement a counter, making it an excellent project for learning Kotlin and Android development basics.

## Features
- **Counter Functionality**: Increment and reset to zero a counter value.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface with buttons to adjust the counter.
- **State Persistence**: Retains the counter value during device rotations.

## How to Use the App
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/DrSkyRitik-15/Count-App>
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Connect an Android device or use an emulator.
4. Build and run the app.
5. Use the "count" and "reset" buttons to adjust the counter value.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Practiced Kotlin basics, including variables, functions, and event handling.
- Designed layouts and UI interactions in Android Studio.
- Implemented state management to handle screen rotations.



## Next Steps
- Add a reset button to set the counter back to zero.
- Enhance UI with animations for button clicks.
- Implement themes and styles for better aesthetics.
